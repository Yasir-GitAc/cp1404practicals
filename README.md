# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions and learning progress for the CP1404 subject practicals at [James Cook University](https://www.jcu.edu.au/).  
I am a student who is keen to learn and improve my programming and software development skills, especially in Python.  
You will find code for weekly practical tasks, including exercises on classes, file I/O, data structures, and clean coding practices.

## Main Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- **Write functions for each logical task**  
  Breaking code into clear, reusable functions makes it easier to read, test, and debug.
- **Use meaningful variable and function names**  
  Good naming helps other people (and my future self) understand the purpose of each part of the code.
- **Follow consistent formatting and PEP 8 style**  
  Using indentation, comments, and blank lines makes code look tidy and professional.
